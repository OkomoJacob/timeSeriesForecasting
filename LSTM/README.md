### Time Series Forecasting : Extrapolation
Having aking predictions about the future is called extrapolation in the classical statistical handling of time series data.

More modern fields focus on the topic and refer to it as time series forecasting.

Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations.

Descriptive models can borrow for the future (i.e. to smooth or remove noise), they only seek to best describe the data.
