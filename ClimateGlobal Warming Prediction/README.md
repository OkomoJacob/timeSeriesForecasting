## Global Warming and Climate Change Prediction using Time Series Analysis

It is an unmaskable fact that, lately, there has been a negative trend in the rate of Global Average Temp.This is negatively impacting the gloabl population as most(if not all) depend directly on the climate.
##### Negativee impacts include but are not limited to:
    - Melting of ICE and Snows
    - Rising of the Sea Levels
    - 

Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
