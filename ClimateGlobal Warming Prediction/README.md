It is an unmaskable fact that, lately, there has been a negative trend in the rate of Global Average Temp.This is negatively impacting the gloabl population as most(if not all) depend directly on the climate.
##### Negative impacts include but are not limited to:
    - Melting of ICE and Snows
    - Rising of the Sea Levels

Date: starts in 1743 for average land temperature.
By 1850 , there were provisions for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature.
